### I created this dication application through use of google Chrome's speech recognition api. This app currently only works on google Chrome as all other browsers have alternate implementations, usually client-side approaches, of handling speech. Chrome's speech recognition handles language on the server-side and returns everything back to the user to sort out, whereas the other browers rely on the user's own processing power to process language and contextualize it with grammar.


Once the user begins recording, the user will have to accept Chrome's microphone access and then when the user is done recording they have to click on the "End Dictation" button to end Chrome's microphone access permissions.
